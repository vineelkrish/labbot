=== SUBJECT: DBMS ===

--- CONCEPT: Database ---  
Definition:
A database is an organized collection of logically related data stored in a structured manner so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Explanation:
Instead of storing data in separate files, a database stores data centrally so multiple users and applications can access it simultaneously without redundancy and inconsistency.

Example:
A college database storing student details, courses, marks, and attendance.

Key Points:
- Stores related data together
- Reduces redundancy
- Enables multi-user access
- Ensures consistency


--- CONCEPT: DBMS ---
Definition:
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to create, store, retrieve, and manage data in a database efficiently.

Explanation:
DBMS acts as an interface between user and database. Users never access data directly from disk; they use queries, and DBMS handles storage, indexing, concurrency and security.

Example:
MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL

Key Points:
- Provides abstraction
- Controls redundancy
- Handles concurrency
- Provides security


--- CONCEPT: Three Level Architecture ---
Definition:
Three level architecture is a DBMS design that separates database into three levels to achieve data independence.

Explanation:
It hides complexity from users and allows database modification without affecting applications.

Levels:
1. External Level — User view
2. Conceptual Level — Logical structure
3. Internal Level — Physical storage

Example:
Changing file storage structure without changing user queries.

Key Points:
- Improves security
- Supports abstraction
- Enables data independence


--- CONCEPT: Data Independence ---
Definition:
Data independence is the ability to change database schema without affecting application programs.

Explanation:
Applications continue to work even if storage or structure changes.

Types:
Physical Data Independence — Change storage without affecting logical schema  
Logical Data Independence — Change logical schema without affecting users

Key Points:
- Very important goal of DBMS
- Reduces maintenance cost
- Makes system scalable


--- CONCEPT: Schema vs Instance ---
Definition:
Schema is the structure of database, instance is the actual data stored at a particular time.

Explanation:
Schema is permanent design, instance changes frequently.

Example:
Table structure = Schema  
Table rows = Instance

Key Points:
- Schema rarely changes
- Instance changes continuously


--- CONCEPT: Super Key ---
Definition:
A super key is a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identifies a record in a table.

Explanation:
It may contain extra attributes but still uniquely identifies row.

Example:
Student(ID, Name, Email)
Super keys:
ID
ID + Name
ID + Email

Key Points:
- Can contain redundant attributes
- Every candidate key is super key
- Not minimal


--- CONCEPT: Candidate Key ---
Definition:
A candidate key is a minimal super key that uniquely identifies a tuple.

Explanation:
It contains no unnecessary attributes.

Example:
Student(ID, Email)
Both uniquely identify → candidate keys

Key Points:
- Minimal uniqueness
- Many candidate keys possible


--- CONCEPT: Primary Key ---
Definition:
A primary key is the candidate key chosen to uniquely identify records in a relation.

Explanation:
Only one primary key is selected among candidate keys.

Key Points:
- Cannot be NULL
- Cannot be duplicate
- Only one per table


--- CONCEPT: Foreign Key ---
Definition:
A foreign key is an attribute in one table that references the primary key of another table.

Explanation:
It establishes relationship between tables and enforces referential integrity.

Example:
Student(ID)
Enroll(StudentID)

Key Points:
- Maintains relationships
- Prevents invalid references


--- CONCEPT: Referential Integrity ---
Definition:
Referential integrity ensures that a foreign key value must exist in the referenced table.

Explanation:
Prevents orphan records.

Example:
Cannot enroll a student whose ID does not exist in Student table.

Key Points:
- Maintains consistency
- Enforced by DBMS


--- CONCEPT: Transaction ---
Definition:
A transaction is a sequence of database operations that forms a single logical unit of work.

Explanation:
A transaction groups multiple read and write operations so the database remains correct even if a crash occurs. The operations must either complete entirely or have no effect at all.

Key Points:

* Logical unit of execution
* Begins with BEGIN TRANSACTION
* Ends with COMMIT or ROLLBACK
* Used in banking and booking systems
* Maintains data reliability

Examples:
Transfer ₹500 from Account A to B:

1. Deduct from A
2. Add to B
   If system crashes after step 1, rollback restores the original balance.

--- CONCEPT: ACID Properties ---
Definition:
ACID properties guarantee reliable and safe execution of database transactions.

Explanation:
They ensure correctness of data even during system failure or concurrent access by multiple users.

Key Points:

* Atomicity → All or nothing
* Consistency → Valid state maintained
* Isolation → Transactions execute independently
* Durability → Data persists permanently

Examples:
After ATM withdrawal confirmation, balance will not revert after restart.

--- CONCEPT: Atomicity ---
Definition:
Atomicity ensures a transaction either fully completes or does not occur at all.

Explanation:
If any step fails, DBMS reverses all previous steps using undo mechanisms.

Key Points:

* Prevents partial updates
* Implemented using logs
* Important in financial operations

Examples:
Payment deducted but order not placed → rollback returns money.

--- CONCEPT: Consistency ---
Definition:
Consistency ensures database moves from one valid state to another valid state.

Explanation:
All constraints and rules must remain satisfied after transaction execution.

Key Points:

* Enforces integrity constraints
* Prevents invalid values
* Ensures meaningful data

Examples:
Bank balance cannot become negative after withdrawal.

--- CONCEPT: Isolation ---
Definition:
Isolation ensures transactions execute independently without interference.

Explanation:
Even if multiple transactions run simultaneously, each behaves as if executed alone.

Key Points:

* Controlled using locks
* Prevents anomalies
* Required for concurrency safety

Examples:
Two users booking same seat → only one booking succeeds.

--- CONCEPT: Durability ---
Definition:
Durability ensures committed data remains permanently stored.

Explanation:
Once commit occurs, data survives crashes or power failure.

Key Points:

* Stored on disk
* Uses recovery logs
* Permanent after commit

Examples:
Money transfer remains recorded after system restart.

--- CONCEPT: Concurrency Control ---
Definition:
Concurrency control manages simultaneous transactions without conflicts.

Explanation:
Multiple users accessing the database together may cause inconsistency. DBMS coordinates execution order to maintain correctness.

Key Points:

* Prevents data corruption
* Maintains isolation
* Uses locking protocols

Examples:
Online ticket booking handling thousands of users.

--- CONCEPT: Lost Update Problem ---
Definition:
Occurs when two transactions update the same data and one overwrites the other.

Explanation:
Both transactions read same old value and final result ignores one update.

Key Points:

* Common concurrency anomaly
* Prevented using locks

Examples:
T1 adds ₹100
T2 adds ₹200
Final value becomes ₹1100 instead of ₹1300

--- CONCEPT: Dirty Read ---
Definition:
Reading uncommitted data written by another transaction.

Explanation:
If first transaction rolls back, second transaction used invalid data.

Key Points:

* Temporary incorrect data
* Prevented by isolation levels

Examples:
Seeing updated balance before payment succeeds.

--- CONCEPT: Two Phase Locking (2PL) ---
Definition:
A locking protocol that ensures serializable execution of transactions.

Explanation:
Transaction has two phases:

1. Growing phase → acquire locks
2. Shrinking phase → release locks

Key Points:

* Guarantees serializability
* Prevents anomalies

Examples:
Transaction locks a record before modifying it.

--- CONCEPT: SQL ---
Definition:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with relational databases.

Explanation:
SQL allows users to store, retrieve, update and delete data in tables.

Key Points:

* Declarative language
* Used in MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
* Case insensitive

Examples:
SELECT * FROM Students;

--- CONCEPT: DDL Commands ---
Definition:
Data Definition Language commands define database structure.

Explanation:
They create and modify schema objects like tables and databases.

Key Points:

* CREATE
* ALTER
* DROP
* TRUNCATE

Examples:
CREATE TABLE Student(id INT, name VARCHAR(50));

--- CONCEPT: DML Commands ---
Definition:
Data Manipulation Language commands modify table data.

Explanation:
They insert, update and remove records.

Key Points:

* INSERT
* UPDATE
* DELETE

Examples:
INSERT INTO Student VALUES(1,'Ravi');

--- CONCEPT: DQL ---
Definition:
Data Query Language retrieves data from database.

Explanation:
Used for searching and filtering records.

Key Points:

* SELECT
* WHERE
* ORDER BY
* GROUP BY

Examples:
SELECT name FROM Student WHERE id=1;

--- CONCEPT: Primary Key ---
Definition:
A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Explanation:
No two rows can have same primary key value and it cannot be NULL.

Key Points:

* Unique
* Not null
* One per table

Examples:
Roll number in student table.

--- CONCEPT: Foreign Key ---
Definition:
A foreign key links one table to another.

Explanation:
It maintains referential integrity between tables.

Key Points:

* References primary key
* Prevents invalid references

Examples:
Student(dept_id) referencing Department(id)

--- CONCEPT: Normalization ---
Definition:
Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy.

Explanation:
Tables are divided into smaller tables and relationships established.

Key Points:

* Removes duplication
* Improves consistency
* Uses normal forms

Examples:
Separating student and department tables.

--- CONCEPT: First Normal Form (1NF) ---
Definition:
Table contains only atomic values and no repeating groups.

Explanation:
Each field must contain a single value.

Key Points:

* No multi-valued attributes
* Each cell single value

Examples:
Phone numbers stored in separate rows.

--- CONCEPT: Second Normal Form (2NF) ---
Definition:
Table is in 1NF and no partial dependency exists.

Explanation:
Non-key attributes depend on entire primary key.

Key Points:

* Removes partial dependency

Examples:
Course name depends only on course_id, not student_id.

--- CONCEPT: Third Normal Form (3NF) ---
Definition:
Table is in 2NF and has no transitive dependency.

Explanation:
Non-key attributes depend only on primary key.

Key Points:

* Removes indirect dependency

Examples:
Student table should not store department location.

--- CONCEPT: Indexing ---
Definition:
Indexing improves data retrieval speed.

Explanation:
Creates data structure to quickly locate records without scanning full table.

Key Points:

* Faster SELECT queries
* Slightly slower INSERT/UPDATE
* Uses B-Tree or Hash

Examples:
Searching student by roll number quickly.

--- CONCEPT: B-Tree Index ---
Definition:
Balanced tree index structure used in databases.

Explanation:
Maintains sorted data and allows logarithmic search time.

Key Points:

* Default index in most DBMS
* Efficient range queries

Examples:
Searching records between id 100 and 200.
