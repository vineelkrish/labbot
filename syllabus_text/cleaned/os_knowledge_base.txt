Definition: Kernel-level threads are managed by the operating system and are recognized by the kernel.

--- CONCEPT: Deadlock ---
Definition: Deadlock is a situation in which a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource held by another process.
Key Points:
- Processes wait indefinitely
